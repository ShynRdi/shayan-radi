        Hello! My name is Shayan Radi. Welcome to my personal website. I am a
        computer scientist who has a big interest in art and Astronomy. I am
        really into Machine learning and artificial intelligence paths. Other
        parts of my brain are truly into arts and especially music. Worth
        mentioning, I have an art-friendly history. Furthermore, I can consider
        myself as a great photographer and someone who deeply knows music. My
        life's goal is to leave my footprint on the interdisciplinary world
        between the world of art and the modern world of artificial
        intelligence.
